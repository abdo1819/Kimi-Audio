# Chain of Thought (CoT) Implementation for Kimi Audio Model

## Overview

This document describes the Chain of Thought (CoT) implementation for the Kimi Audio model, which allows separating internal reasoning from final responses. This enables the model to "think" before responding, making the reasoning process transparent and potentially improving response quality.

## Current Status

**The original Kimi Audio model does NOT have built-in chain of thought capabilities.** The implementation provided here extends the base model to support CoT functionality.

## Architecture

### Key Components

1. **CoT Tokens** (`kimia_infer/utils/cot_tokens.py`)
   - Special tokens for marking thinking vs response sections
   - Parsing utilities for extracting thinking and response parts

2. **CoT Model** (`kimia_infer/api/cot_kimia.py`)
   - Extended KimiAudio class with CoT capabilities
   - Methods for generating responses with thinking separation

3. **Examples** (`examples/cot_example.py`)
   - Comprehensive usage examples
   - Different CoT patterns and use cases

### Special Tokens

The CoT implementation uses the following simplified special tokens:

```
<|im_kimia_thinking_start|>    # Start of thinking process
<|im_kimia_thinking_end|>      # End of thinking process (auto-inserted)
<|im_kimia_response_start|>    # Start of final response
```

**Note**: These tokens are enforced at the start of generation when CoT is enabled, and the thinking end token is automatically inserted based on the `max_thinking_tokens` parameter.

## Usage

### Basic CoT Generation

```python
from kimia_infer.api.cot_kimia import CoTKimiAudio

# Initialize CoT model
model = CoTKimiAudio(
    model_path="moonshotai/Kimi-Audio-7B-Instruct",
    enable_cot=True
)

# Generate with thinking process
audio_output, text_response, thinking = model.generate_with_cot(
    messages,
    output_type="text",
    max_thinking_tokens=200,
    show_thinking=True
)

print(f"Thinking: {thinking}")
print(f"Response: {text_response}")
```

### Thinking-Only Generation

```python
# Generate only thinking process
thinking = model.generate_thinking_only(
    messages,
    max_thinking_tokens=150
)
```

### Key Features

- **Enforced CoT Start**: When `enable_cot=True`, the thinking start token is automatically added
- **Max Thinking Tokens**: Automatically ends thinking after specified token limit
- **Auto-Insertion**: Thinking end and response start tokens are inserted automatically

## Implementation Details

### How It Works

1. **Enforced Start**: When CoT is enabled, `<|im_kimia_thinking_start|>` is automatically added to the conversation
2. **Generation**: The model generates text starting with thinking
3. **Auto-End**: After `max_thinking_tokens`, thinking is automatically ended and response starts
4. **Parsing**: The output is parsed to separate thinking from final response
5. **Optional Display**: Users can choose to see or hide the thinking process

### Generation Flow

```
Input → [Auto-add CoT Start] → Model Generation → [Auto-end Thinking] → Parse Output → {Thinking, Response}
```

### Token Structure

```
<|im_kimia_thinking_start|>
[Thinking process here - auto-ended after max_thinking_tokens]
<|im_kimia_thinking_end|> <|im_kimia_response_start|>
[Final response here]
```

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see the model's reasoning process
2. **Debugging**: Easier to understand why the model gave a particular response
3. **Quality Control**: Can evaluate both reasoning and final output
4. **Educational**: Helps users understand the model's decision-making process

## Limitations

1. **Token Overhead**: CoT tokens consume additional context length
2. **Training Required**: The model needs to be trained to recognize and use CoT tokens
3. **Performance**: May slightly increase generation time
4. **Compatibility**: Requires the model to support the new special tokens

## Training Considerations

To fully implement CoT in the Kimi Audio model, you would need to:

1. **Add CoT tokens to the tokenizer vocabulary**
2. **Create training data with CoT structure**
3. **Fine-tune the model on CoT examples**
4. **Validate CoT token recognition**

### Training Data Format

```json
{
    "conversation": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "message_type": "text", 
            "content": "What is the main topic of this audio?"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "message_type": "audio",
            "content": "path/to/audio.wav"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "message_type": "text",
            "content": "<|im_kimia_thinking_start|>\nLet me analyze this audio step by step:\n1. First, I'll listen to the content\n2. Then identify the main themes\n3. Finally, I'll provide a summary\n<|im_kimia_thinking_end|>\n\n<|im_kimia_response_start|>\nThe main topic is about environmental conservation and sustainable living practices.\n<|im_kimia_response_end|>"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-step Reasoning**: Support for complex multi-step thinking processes
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Add confidence scores to thinking steps
3. **Interactive CoT**: Allow users to guide the thinking process
4. **CoT Templates**: Predefined thinking templates for different tasks
5. **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the thinking process

## Conclusion

The Chain of Thought implementation provides a foundation for making the Kimi Audio model's reasoning process transparent and controllable. While the current implementation is a proof-of-concept, it demonstrates how to separate thinking from response generation and provides a framework for more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.
